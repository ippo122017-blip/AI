# Flutter Timer PoC Setup Notes

This repository currently runs inside the `python/flutter_timer_poc` folder.

## Current Status
- Flutter SDK is not installed on this machine (`flutter` command missing).
- Created this placeholder so PoC tasks (P-01..P-06) from `docs/flutter_timer_poc_plan.md` have a working directory ready.

## Next Steps
1. Install Flutter 3.24+ and add it to PATH.
2. Run `flutter create circuit_timer_poc` within this directory.
3. Follow the PoC plan tasks P-01..P-06.
4. Document results in `docs/flutter_timer_poc_plan.md` and `docs/mobile_timer_requirements.md`.
